# Cloud IAM Takeover Lab (AWS)

**Project Idea:** A technical demonstration of common privilege escalation flaws in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). This involves exploiting misconfigurations to achieve "domain-like" control within a target AWS account.

**Status:** Currently defining the exploitation path and building the vulnerable lab environment using Terraform.

**What it will demonstrate:**
* Advanced knowledge of **AWS IAM policy evaluation** and trust relationships.
* Hands-on experience with privilege escalation tooling (e.g., Pacu, enumerate-iam).
* Ability to design and implement **least privilege** security controls.
